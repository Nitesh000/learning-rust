#### Some common `Cargo` commands

- `new`: for creating a new project
- `build`: for building a project which causes a `.target` file. And inside which a we can find the executable file for the project
- `run`: like the `build` it also compiles but doesn't create a `target` folder.
- `check`: We can just check for the code is being compiled or not.
